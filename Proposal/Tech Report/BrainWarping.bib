It reads just like a collection of journal papers with the amount of coherence between topics and the level of detail in the explanations that one might expect to find in a collection of journal papers. It seems more like a ploy to make money than to actually contribute something meaningful to the field. I would recommend saving you money and learning the material online.''},
