To run webcrawler, download the javascript files, and .json file. 
You must have Node.JS installed on your computer. 

Inside the root of the folder with the javascript files and .json file in commandline, run "npm install." Then, start up an instance of MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)

After that, run "node pubMed.js searchKey" where searchKey is whatever searchKey you would like the webcrawler to search for in PubMed.

Run "node search.js" to query for an article.
